// This is a basic Flutter widget test.
//
// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility in the flutter_test package. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.

    // Build the app and trigger a frame.
    await tester.pumpWidget(const DailyPulseApp());

    // The app should show the title in the app bar or logo area.
